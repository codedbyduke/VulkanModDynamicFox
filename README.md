# <a href="https://github.com/xCollateral/VulkanMod"> <img src="./src/main/resources/assets/vulkanmod/Vlogo.png" width="30" height="30"/> </a> VulkanMod (DynamicFox Fork)

This is a fabric mod that introduces a brand new **Vulkan** based voxel rendering engine to **Minecraft Java** in order to both replace the default OpenGL renderer and bring performance improvements.

Also, it now adds a **DynamicFox**.  
Yes, really.  
Blame [TryDkg.wtf](https://trydkg.wtf) for the typo that started it all:  
> *"When dynamic fox setting in vulcan mod"*

## ü¶ä What is DynamicFox?

A typo. A prophecy. A new entity.  
This fork does **not** add DynamicFog. It adds something far more powerful: the **DynamicFox**.  
It‚Äôs fast. It‚Äôs mysterious. It‚Äôs probably judging your render pipeline.

### Why?
- Highly experimental project that overhauls and modernizes the internal renderer for Minecraft. <br>
- Updates the renderer from OpenGL 3.2 to Vulkan 1.2.  <br>
- Provides a potential reference for a future-proof Vulkan codebase for Minecraft Java. <br>
- Utilizes the VulkanAPI to allow for capabilities not always possible with OpenGL. <br>
- Including reduced CPU Overhead and use of newer, modern hardware capabilities. <br>
- Also includes a **fox**. A dynamic one. ü¶ä

## FAQ
- Remember to check the [Wiki](https://github.com/xCollateral/VulkanMod/wiki) we wrote before asking for support!
- No, the fox is not in the wiki. It defies documentation.

## Notes
- This mod is still in development, please report issues in the [issue tab](https://github.com/xCollateral/VulkanMod/issues) with logs attached!
- This mod isn't just "Minecraft on Vulkan" (e.g: [zink](https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/zink.html) ), it is a full rewrite of the Minecraft renderer.
- Also, there's a fox now. It‚Äôs dynamic. Don‚Äôt ask how. Just accept it.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **If your issue involves the DynamicFox, do NOT bother xCollateral.**  
  That chaos was unleashed by **CodedByDuke**, not the original author.  
  All fox-related bugs, existential crises, and typo-induced anomalies should be directed to me.
